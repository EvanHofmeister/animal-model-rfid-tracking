Arduino RFID Project - Avian Research
============
This is the initial prototype of an Arduino based RFID reader to be used to monitor the activity level of captive birds being used as research animal models. This device allows researcher to easily quantify how often each bird enters specific area of the enclosure (e.g., near food/water dispenser) without relying on reviewing video recordings of activity. An Arduino based RFID reader was also a prefferable solultion since all components of the system are readily available, relatively cheap, and can be reasonably assebled by a researcher at scale.



## System in action:

## The system uses 3 components:
- Arduino R3
- RDM 6300 RFID reader
- Particle Photon MCR (similar to ESP32)
